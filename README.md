# Caster3D
CPU raycaster written in C++.

# Build
Use [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) to create project files. Building should be relatively simple from there. Just build in your IDE of choice or `make.` if you're using make. 

(e.g. Run `premake5 vs2019` to create solution files for Visual Studio 2019)
